# Chinese-MNIST-Recognizer
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing and classifying handwritten Chinese characters from the Chinese MNIST dataset.
The successful completion of this project will result in a reliable and accurate Chinese MNIST recognizer, which can be used for various applications such as optical character recognition (OCR), language translation, and handwriting analysis. The project will contribute to advancing the field of Chinese character recognition and provide valuable insights into the potential of deep learning for handwritten character classification tasks.
## Data Description
One hundred Chinese nationals took part in data collection. Each participant wrote with a standard black ink pen all 15 numbers in a table with 15 designated regions drawn on a white A4 paper. This process was repeated 10 times with each participant. Each sheet was scanned with a resolution of 300x300 pixels.
This file contains the 15000 observations and 4098 columns. Columns 1 to 4096 represent each pixel of the image (64x64). The last two columns denote the value label and the original Chinese character.
